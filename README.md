# Star Wars Hangman

A game of Hangman with a Star Wars theme.

## How to Play

* The user guesses the words by pressing whichever keys he or she thinks might represent the letters that will correctly complete them.

* When a word is guessed correctly, the picture in the lefthand column will change to one related to the guessed word.

* When this happens, a soundbite of something related to the word will play as well, temporarily interrupting the Star Wars theme if it's still playing.

* If a soundbite associated with a previously guessed word is still playing, it will be cut short and replaced by the new one.

* Wins will be recorded beneath "Wins."

* The number of guesses remaining as well as the letters already guessed will be displayed beneath the current word.

* If the number of remaining guesses is reduced to 0, the game will display a new word and the user will lose the opportunity to guess the previous one correctly.

* There are 12 words total, which will be selected in a random order.

* Once all 12 words have been exhausted, a gif will replace the text and image from the game.

* A message will appear beneath it, assessing the user's performance.

* Depending on the quality of that performance, [one](assets/audio/empire-ending-song.mp3) of [two](assets/audio/throne-room-theme) songs will play.

* The one that plays if the user does poorly will be preceded by yet another [soundbite](assets/audio/luke-no.mov).
