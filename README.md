# Word-Guess-Game

Star Wars Hangman

This is a game of hangman with a Star Wars theme.

HOW TO

-- The user guesses the words by pressing whichever keys he or she thinks might represent the letters that will correctly complete them.

-- When a word is guessed correctly, the picture in the lefthand column will change to one related to the guessed word.

-- When this happens, a soundbite of something related to the word will play as well, temporarily interrupting the Star Wars theme if it's still playing.

-- Wins will be recorded beneath "Wins."

-- The number of guesses remaining as well as the letters already guessed will be displayed beneath the current word.

-- There are 12 words total, which will be selected in a random order.

-- Once all 12 words have been exhausted, a gif will replace the text and image from the game.

-- A message will appear beneath it, assessing the user's performance.

-- Depending on the quality of that performance, [one](assets/audio/empire-ending-song.mp3) of [two](assets/audio/throne-room-theme] songs will play.

-- The one that plays if the user does poorly will be accompanied by another [soundbite](assets/audio/luke-no.mov).
